Hi Nicholas, What specific styles or themes do you envision for your Amazon graphics? I have a strong background in graphic design, particularly for Amazon brands, where I’ve successfully created listing images and A+ pages that drive sales.

Using tool Adobe Photoshop, I can turn around projects quickly while ensuring excellent communication throughout the process. I aim to deliver high-quality graphics that align with your brand vision and stand out in the marketplace.

I’d love to start with one project and showcase my work. For pricing, I can provide tailored options based on your requirements. Please check out my portfolio https://bit.ly/2NfJ3E9 for examples of my previous Amazon graphics.


Looking forward to the opportunity to work together!

Best,
Mughaiz Rana
